Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

int low = 0;
    int high = nums.size()-1;  // remember we're using these to store indexes
    int mid;
    while (low <= high){
         mid = (low + high)/2;
        if(nums[mid] == target){
            return mid;
        }
        if(target < nums[mid]){
            high = mid -1;
        }
        else(low = mid +1);
    }
    return -1;
