Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
    // we can do this using two pointers, one to iterate through the array and another tracking where the zero's are
    int n = nums.size();
    int j = 0;  // we're going to make j stop when there's a zero, and then replace that zero with the next non zero element that i comes across
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        if(nums[i] != 0){
            nums[j] = nums[i]; // make the element at j equal to i
            j++; //iterate j
        }
        // now we need to fill in the elements at the back of the array with 0's
        
        }

         while(j < n){
             nums[j] = 0;
             j++;
         }

    }    
    
};
