There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.


class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        
        int sum = 0;  // start the sum at 0
        int max = 0;
        int n = gain.size();

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i ){
         sum += gain[i];
        //  if(sum > max){
        //      max = sum;
        //  }
        max = std::max(sum,max);

        }
        
        return max;




    }
};
