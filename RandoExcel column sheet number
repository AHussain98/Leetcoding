Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.


class Solution {
public:
    int titleToNumber(string columnTitle) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(auto c: columnTitle) {  // for every char in the column name, starting from the left
            int x = c - 'A' + 1;  // -A because that turns it into a number, add 1 to get teh column number
            ans = ans * 26 + x;  // 26 is out base, there are 26 chars in the alphabet
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
